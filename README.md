# Deploying OpenStack with Chef Cookbooks
This project aims to make OpenStack deployments using the [Rackspace Private Cloud Cookbooks](https://github.com/rcbops/chef-cookbooks) easier by automating the deployment of the Primary Controller/Chef Server node. From there, additional nodes can be automatically bootstrapped using [Spiceweasel](https://github.com/mattray/spiceweasel).
